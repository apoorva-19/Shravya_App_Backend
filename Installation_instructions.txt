4. To check if postgresql has been installed successfully:
	$ sudo -u postgres psql
	
	* postgres is the default user 
	
	** Create local database
	$ sudo -u postgres createdb shravya
	
	* shravya is the name of our BE Project
	* The owner of this database will be postgres (default owner)
	* The default database is postgres
	
	** To change the database 
	postgres=# \c shravya
	
	** To establish the conection between the database and the backend the user will require a password. By default postgres password authentication is disabled.
